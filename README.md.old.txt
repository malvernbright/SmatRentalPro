## Step By Step To Run this backend

### Linux
```
make
or 
sudo make
```
### Windows
To run a Makefile on Windows, you'll need to use a terminal emulator or a command prompt that supports GNU Make. Here are the steps:
* Install GNU Make for Windows:
    - Download and install GNU Make from the official website or use a package manager like Chocolatey or Scoop.
    - Add the Make executable to your system's PATH environment variable.
* Open a terminal emulator or command prompt:
    - Use Git Bash, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), or a command prompt like Windows Terminal or PowerShell.
* Navigate to the directory containing the Makefile:
    - Use the cd command to change directories.
* Run the Makefile:
    - Type make and press Enter to run the default target.
    - Type make and press Enter to run a specific target.

Example:
```
make all
make clean
make install
```
Note: If you're using a command prompt, you might need to use the full path to the Make executable, like C:\Program Files\GNU Make\bin\make.exe.
